# Website

## Local development

To start the local development server, run the following command:

```bash
bundle exec rake site:serve
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the site. Updates to the style CSS will be reflected after a reload. If you update the README.md you will need to run `bundle exec rake site:prepare` to see the updates reflected in the site.
